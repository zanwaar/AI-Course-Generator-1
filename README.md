# Custom Course Creator - Full Stack Web Application

This is a full-stack web application built using **Next.js**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**, designed to enable users to create custom courses with AI-generated content and curated video resources. The app utilizes the **Gemini API** for AI content generation, the **YouTube API** for video integration, and **Clerk** for user authentication.

## Features
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimized routing.
- **React** for building interactive UI components.
- **Drizzle ORM** for managing database interactions.
- **TailwindCSS** for modern and responsive UI design.
- **Shadcn UI** for enhanced UI components.
- **Clerk** for user authentication and access control.
- **Gemini API** for generating AI-driven course content.
- **YouTube API** for video integration and curation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 14.x
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **PostgreSQL** (for database with Drizzle ORM)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/varun442/AI-Course-Generator.git
cd AI-Course-Generator
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<your-clerk-frontend-api>
CLERK_API_KEY=<your-clerk-api-key>

GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your-youtube-api-key>

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database-name>

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Database Migration
Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and create a database. Use Drizzle ORM to set up the schema:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit migrate:run
```

### Run the application
To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit the app at `[http://localhost:3000](https://ai-course-generator-ten.vercel.app/)`.

## Configuration

### Clerk
Clerk provides user authentication for the application. Ensure you set up your project on Clerk's website and configure the necessary API keys in the `.env.local` file.

### Gemini API
This app leverages the Gemini API to generate AI-driven content for courses. You need to sign up for an API key from Gemini API.

### YouTube API
For video integration, the application uses the YouTube Data API. You can get an API key from the Google Developer Console.

## Usage

### Creating a Course
1. Sign Up / Log In: Use Clerk authentication to sign up or log in.
2. Generate AI Content: Use the Gemini API integration to automatically generate content for your custom course.
3. Add Video Resources: Search and integrate videos from YouTube using the YouTube API.
4. Save and Manage Courses: Save courses and manage them through your user profile.

### Admin Panel
Admins can manage user permissions, view generated content, and perform other administrative tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React framework with built-in server-side rendering (SSR).
- **React**: For building dynamic UI components.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Simple, type-safe ORM for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive UIs.
- **Shadcn UI**: A modern UI component library for enhanced UI elements.
- **Clerk**: Authentication solution for user management.
- **Gemini API**: AI-driven content generation API.
- **YouTube API**: Used for searching and embedding video resources.

## API Integration

### Clerk API
Clerk handles user authentication and provides the necessary endpoints for signing up, logging in, and managing users.

### Gemini API
The Gemini API is used for generating AI-driven content for each course. You can customize content by sending prompts and receiving responses from the API.

### YouTube API
The YouTube API is integrated for searching video content that can be added to courses. Use the API to curate video playlists directly into the course creation workflow.
